I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/School-of-Computing.aspx) at [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/Pages/default.aspx). My research focuses on **quantum computing** and its intersection with machine learning, security, and privacy, with emphasis on quantum machine learning, error modeling and mitigation, and circuit compilation.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from William & Mary, where I was advised by [Prof. Qun Li](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~liqun/). I also hold a M.S. in Computer Science from Syracuse University and a B.S. in Information Security from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
