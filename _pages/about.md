I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computing](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/School-of-Computing.aspx) at [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/Pages/default.aspx). My research focuses on **quantum computing** and its intersection with machine learning, security, and privacy, with emphasis on quantum machine learning, error modeling and mitigation, and circuit compilation.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from William & Mary, where I was advised by [Prof. Qun Li](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~liqun/). I also hold a M.S. in Computer Science from Syracuse University and a B.S. in Information Security from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
